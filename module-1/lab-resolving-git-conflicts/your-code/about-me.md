 
I am Ana Murillo

I am from Madridejos, a town in Toledo
Now I'm beginning my Ironhack Data course, which I find hard because I have 0 experience in data. 
I am here because i find data intersesting and I want to learn.
Good revews brought me to Ironhack.
After the bootcamp I hope to find a good job.
My career goal is to be an eficient data analyst.
